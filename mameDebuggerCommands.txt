I think MAME is supposed to remember your command history, but it's not.

So dumping useful/interesting commands here



# when 2ec92 is hit,
# dump to the console the current value of 108284 and continue
bpset 2ec92,1,{ printf "end=%x",b@108284; g }

# set a watchpoint for when a dino rotation tile gets sent to vram
wpset 0x3c0002,1,w,wpdata == 8a51
