I think MAME is supposed to remember your command history, but it's not.

So dumping useful/interesting commands here



# when 2ec92 is hit,
# dump to the console the current value of 108284 and continue
bpset 2ec92,1,{ printf "end=%x",b@108284; g }

# set a watchpoint for when a dino rotation tile gets sent to vram
wpset 0x3c0002,1,w,wpdata == 8a51

# break at 2cee if d1 is currently 5b80 and the word
# A0 is pointing to is 8a50
# this was used to break when the dino rotation tile is being set
bpset 2cee,d1 == 5b80 && w@a0 == 8a50


# watch BIOS_USE_MODE change
wp 10fdaf,1,w,pc < c00000, { printf "mode set to:%d at %x",wpdata,pc; g }
